The "npm init" command generates the package.json file by asking you a series of questions.
The package.json file exists so that the node_modules folder doesn't have to be downloaded.
When installing a node.js app, the required dependencies can be downloaded and installed.
There are 2 kinds of dependencies in the package.json file -> Dev Dependencies and Production Dependencies.

Dev Dependencies are those packages that're used for development only. They're listed as "devDependencies" in package.json.
Production Dependencies are those packages that're necessary for the app to run. They're listed as "dependencies" in package.json.

When installing a package as a dev dependency, we use "npm install <package_name> -D".
When installing a package as a production dependency, we use "npm install <package_name>".
When removing a dev dependency, we use "npm uninstall <package_name> -D".
When removing a production dependency, we use "npm uninstall <package_name>".

A package version number "a.b.c" has 3 parts: "a" is the Major Version, "b" is the Minor Version and "c" is the Patch Version.
A package version number prefixed by "^" allows new minor versions / new patches to be installed.
A package version number prefixed by "~" allows new patches to be installed.
A package version number indicated by "*", allows the latest version to be installed.

A particular package version can be installed using "npm install <package_name>@<version>".
